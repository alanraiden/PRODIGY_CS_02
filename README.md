# Image Encryption Tool

This is a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation to encrypt and decrypt images. It allows users to select an image, apply a basic mathematical operation to each pixel using a key, and save the encrypted or decrypted image.

## Features
- **Encrypt Images**: Encrypts an image by adjusting RGB values of each pixel based on a user-provided key.
- **Decrypt Images**: Decrypts an encrypted image using the same key to retrieve the original image.
- **User Interface**: Built with Tkinter for a simple, interactive user experience.

## How It Works
The program encrypts and decrypts images by modifying each pixelâ€™s RGB values using a basic shift determined by the encryption key. This approach provides a basic level of security by scrambling the color values.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6 or later**
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library (PIL) to handle image processing.
- **Tkinter**: Standard Python library for creating graphical interfaces.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Muhammedshahil24/-PRODIGY_CS_02-.git
    cd -PRODIGY_CS_02-
    ```

2. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install pillow
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the program**:
    ```bash
    python image_encryption_tool.py
    ```

2. **Encrypt an Image**:
    - Enter a numeric key for encryption.
    - Click "Encrypt Image" and choose an image file to encrypt.
    - Choose the location and name for the output encrypted image file.

3. **Decrypt an Image**:
    - Enter the same numeric key used for encryption.
    - Click "Decrypt Image" and select the encrypted image file.
    - Choose the location and name for the output decrypted image file.

### Example

1. **Encryption Example**:
   - Original image file: `example.jpg`
   - Encryption key: `10`
   - Encrypted file saved as: `encrypted_image.png`

2. **Decryption Example**:
   - Encrypted image file: `encrypted_image.png`
   - Decryption key: `10`
   - Decrypted file saved as: `decrypted_image.png`

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Key**: If a non-integer key is entered, the program will display an error message.
- **File Not Found**: If an invalid file is selected or the file path does not exist, the program will alert the user.
